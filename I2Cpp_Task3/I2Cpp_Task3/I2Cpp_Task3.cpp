//Problem Statements
//
//This information will help guide your response to item four(4).
//
//Problem statements summarize key information about the problemand the 
//environment surrounding it.They are often brief, but can provide detail 
//as necessary to describe the problem.
//
//Consider this sample problem statement written for game engines :
//
//Small development teams may find it expensive to split their resources 
//between building the game engine vs.building the actual game itself.
//Teams may need to dedicate at least 1 - 2 full - time employees(FTEs) 
//to developing the engine as requirements change over the product lifecycle, 
//increasing operational costs.
//
//Developers may choose to use game engines middleware like Unity or Unreal Engine 
//in exchange for a small upfront cost in the form of licenses or royalties.
//Engineers can be instead be dedicated to developing the game instead, 
//requiring less engineersand thus reducing operational costs.
//
//Game engine middleware is often maintained by teams with dedicated R& D
//teams, providing its users with the latest innovations in the games industry 
//at a fraction of the cost.Teams may hire for users experienced in specific 
//game engines, minimizing resources spent on trainingand ramp - up.
//
//If a game engine does not providing the features required for a particular 
//game, its cost savings are reduced.Furthermore, missing features or bugs with 
//the feature set can be difficult to fix if source access is not providing,
//possibly making the game engine more expensive to work with than a custom 
//built one.
//
//
//
//In a few sentences, the passage of text describe the following :
//
//What is the problem ? – The cost of building and maintaining custom game engines
//Who is experiencing the problem ? – Small or new game development teams
//What is needed in a solution to this problem ? – Minimizes the game engine development costs
//The solution, game engines middleware like Unity or Unreal Engine, are described as follows :
//
//How does Unity or Unreal solve this problem ? – Licenses or royalties for the game 
//engine can be much more affordable than building a custom engine
// 
//What are its advantages ?
// 
//Externalized cost of R & D teams
//New hires may require less training and on - boarding to be effective due to common
//knowledge of the game engine
// 
//What are its disadvantages?
// 
//Missing or incomplete features can require teams to devote some or all of the cost 
//of developing those features in - house regardless
// 
//Bugs in the game engine may not be readily diagnosed fixed if source - access is not provided
